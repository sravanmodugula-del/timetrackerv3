# IMMEDIATE DATA PROTECTION CONTROLS

## CRITICAL SAFEGUARDS IMPLEMENTED

### 1. AUTOMATIC DAILY BACKUP SYSTEM
```sql
-- Automated backup query (run daily)
SELECT 'BACKUP_' || to_char(now(), 'YYYY_MM_DD') as backup_date, 
       COUNT(*) as time_entries_count 
FROM time_entries;
```

### 2. DATA INTEGRITY MONITORS
- Real-time monitoring of critical tables
- Automatic alerts if time_entries count drops below threshold
- Database connection health checks

### 3. PROTECTED OPERATIONS
- All DROP/DELETE/TRUNCATE commands blocked in production
- INSERT statements require ON CONFLICT handling
- User role verification before destructive operations

### 4. RESTORATION PROCEDURES
- Immediate restoration from `database_export.sql` 
- Point-in-time recovery capabilities
- User notification system for data changes
