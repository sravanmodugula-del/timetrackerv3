# üö® IMMEDIATE UI TEST - Employee Assignment

**Current Status**: You are ADMIN role, ready to test employee assignment UI

## üéØ THE ISSUE FOUND

**Problem**: Most projects have `isEnterpriseWide: true`, which **HIDES** the employee assignment interface.

**Solution**: You need to test with projects that have `isEnterpriseWide: false` to see employee assignment checkboxes.

## üîß QUICK TEST - STEP BY STEP

### STEP 1: Navigate to Projects
- Go to Projects page in your browser
- You should see "New Project" button (you're admin)

### STEP 2: Create New Project with Employee Assignment
- Click "New Project" 
- Enter name: "Manual UI Test Project"
- Enter description: "Testing employee assignment UI"
- **CRITICAL**: Click on "Project Details" tab
- **FIND**: "Enterprise-wide Project" toggle switch
- **MAKE SURE IT'S OFF** (unchecked) - This is key!

### STEP 3: Test Employee Assignment Tab
- Click "Assigned Employees" tab
- **VERIFY**: You should see employee checkboxes (7 employees available)
- **VERIFY**: Each employee shows Name, Department, Employee ID
- **TEST**: Click some checkboxes
- **VERIFY**: Counter updates "X employee(s) selected"

### STEP 4: Save and Verify
- Click "Create Project"
- **VERIFY**: Project appears in list
- **VERIFY**: No errors

### STEP 5: Test Editing Existing Project
- Look for project "ADMIN TEST - Employee Assignment UI" (I just created it)
- Click "Edit" button on that project
- Click "Assigned Employees" tab 
- **VERIFY**: Employee checkboxes are visible
- **TEST**: Select/deselect employees
- Click "Update Project"

## üö® CRITICAL POINTS

### Why You Might Not See Employee Checkboxes:
1. **Enterprise-wide toggle is ON** - This hides employee assignment
2. **Wrong tab** - Make sure you're on "Assigned Employees" tab
3. **No employees in database** - But we have 7 employees confirmed

### What Should Work:
- ‚úÖ Admin sees "New Project" button
- ‚úÖ "Assigned Employees" tab exists  
- ‚úÖ Employee checkboxes when Enterprise-wide is OFF
- ‚úÖ Selection counter updates
- ‚úÖ Form saves successfully

- Can create/edit projects with assignments
- No error messages

**FAILURE SIGNS:**
