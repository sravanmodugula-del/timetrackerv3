## üîß API-Level Verification (Already Confirmed)

‚úÖ **Admin API Tests**:

## üö® CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED

**Missing Verification:**
1. **UI Functionality**: Employee checkboxes actually work when clicked
2. **Form Submission**: Selected employees properly saved to database
3. **Visual Feedback**: UI updates correctly after role changes
4. **Error Handling**: UI shows errors for insufficient permissions
5. **Data Persistence**: Employee assignments persist after page refresh

## üìã Recommended Next Steps

1. **Manual UI Testing**: Perform the 5 tests listed above
2. **Fix Any Issues**: Address broken UI functionality discovered
3. **Automated Testing**: Get Playwright working for continuous verification

- Project Manager: Employee assignment in project creation/editing  
- Manager: View-only access, no assignment features
- Employee: View-only access to assigned projects only

**Broken UI Would Show:**
