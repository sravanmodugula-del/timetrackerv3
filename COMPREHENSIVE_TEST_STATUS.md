# Comprehensive Employee Assignment Testing Status

**Date**: August 16, 2025  
**Current User Role**: Admin (ready for testing)

## ✅ CONFIRMED WORKING (API Level)

### Role-Based Project Creation
- **Admin**: ✅ Can create projects with `assignedEmployeeIds` array
- **Project Manager**: ✅ Can create projects with employee assignments
- **Manager**: ❌ Correctly blocked with "Insufficient permissions" 
- **Employee**: ❌ Correctly blocked with "Insufficient permissions"

### Role-Based Data Access
- **Admin**: ✅ Sees ALL organizational data (71 time entries, 20+ projects, 7 employees)
- **Project Manager**: ✅ Sees enterprise-wide data scope  
- **Manager**: ✅ Sees department-level data for oversight
- **Employee**: ⚠️ Sees restricted data (16 time entries, assigned projects only)

### API Endpoints Verified
```bash
# All these API calls work correctly:
POST /api/projects (with assignedEmployeeIds)
PUT /api/projects/:id (with assignedEmployeeIds) 
GET /api/employees (role-based filtering)
POST /api/users/change-role (instant role switching)
```

## 🔧 UI COMPONENTS IMPLEMENTED

### Project Creation/Edit Dialog
- ✅ Two-tab interface: "Project Details" + "Assigned Employees"
- ✅ Employee assignment tab with proper `data-testid="tab-employees"`
- ✅ Scrollable employee list with individual checkboxes
- ✅ Each checkbox has `data-testid="checkbox-employee-{id}"`
- ✅ Selection counter: "X employee(s) selected"
- ✅ Form integration with React Hook Form
- ✅ Proper form validation and submission

### Role-Based UI Elements  
- ✅ "New Project" button (`data-testid="button-new-project"`)
- ✅ Edit project buttons (`data-testid="button-edit-project-{id}"`)
- ✅ Permission-based button visibility
- ✅ usePermissions hook integration

### Navigation & Access Control
- ✅ Projects page accessible at `/projects`
- ✅ Role testing page at `/role-testing` for easy role switching
- ✅ Real-time role updates in UI

## ❓ REQUIRES MANUAL VERIFICATION

### Critical UI Functionality (UNTESTED)
1. **Employee Checkbox Interaction**
   - Do checkboxes respond when clicked?
   - Does selection counter update correctly?
   - Are visual states (checked/unchecked) working?

2. **Form Submission & Data Persistence**
   - Do selected employees get saved when creating projects?
   - Do employee assignments persist after page refresh?
   - Are assignments visible when editing existing projects?

3. **Role-Based UI Updates**
   - Do admin users see New Project button?
   - Are Edit buttons hidden for manager/employee roles?
   - Does employee assignment tab appear for authorized roles?

4. **Error Handling**
   - Are permission errors displayed correctly in UI?
   - Does form validation work for required fields?
   - Are API errors communicated to users?
