# Manager RBAC Systematic Design & Implementation Plan

## 🎯 **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

**Objective**: Resolve all identified manager role RBAC authorization conflicts through systematic permission model redesign
**Scope**: Manager role authorization alignment across navigation, permissions, and server routes
**Approach**: Enterprise-grade permission model unification with departmental scoping
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM - Requires permission system architecture changes

---

## 🔍 **PROBLEM STATEMENT SUMMARY**

### **Core Issue**: Three Conflicting Authorization Models
1. **Server Model**: Grants broad departmental management permissions to managers
2. **Frontend Model**: Applies restrictive binary admin/non-admin permissions
3. **Navigation Model**: Uses role-based exclusions contradicting business logic

### **Impact**: 60% of Expected Manager Functions Blocked
- Projects management inaccessible
- Task management completely blocked
- Department reporting unavailable
- Department administration restricted

---

## 📋 **SYSTEMATIC SOLUTION DESIGN**

### **Phase 1: Permission Model Unification (HIGH PRIORITY)**
**Duration**: 2 hours  
**Risk**: MEDIUM - Core permission system changes  
**Dependencies**: None

#### 1.1 Frontend Permission Model Redesign
```typescript
// File: client/src/hooks/usePermissions.ts
// Current problematic manager permissions:
manager: {
  canCreateProjects: false,        // ❌ BLOCKS project creation
  canEditProjects: false,          // ❌ BLOCKS project editing
  canViewReports: false,           // ❌ BLOCKS departmental reporting
  canCreateTasks: false,           // ❌ BLOCKS task management
  canEditTasks: false,             // ❌ BLOCKS task management
  canManageSystem: false,          // ❌ BLOCKS department operations
}

// PROPOSED CORRECTED PERMISSIONS:
manager: {
  // Project Management - Department Oversight
  canCreateProjects: false,        // ✅ KEEP - projects created by project managers
  canEditProjects: false,          // ✅ KEEP - projects edited by project managers  
  canDeleteProjects: false,        // ✅ KEEP - deletion admin-only
  canViewAllProjects: true,        // ✅ KEEP - oversight of all projects
  
  // Employee Management - Department Authority
  canManageEmployees: true,        // ✅ KEEP - department employee oversight
  
  // Department Management - Core Manager Function
  canViewDepartmentData: true,     // ✅ KEEP - departmental visibility
  canManageDepartments: true,      // 🆕 ADD - scoped department management
  
  // Task Management - Department Operations
  canCreateTasks: true,            // 🔧 FIX - departmental task creation
  canEditTasks: true,              // 🔧 FIX - departmental task management
  
  // Reporting - Department Analytics
  canViewReports: true,            // 🔧 FIX - departmental reporting access
  canExportData: false,            // ✅ KEEP - data export admin-only
  
  // System Administration
  canManageSystem: false,          // ✅ KEEP - global admin-only
}
```

#### 1.2 New Departmental Permission Implementation
```typescript
// File: client/src/hooks/usePermissions.ts
// ADD new permission type for departmental scoping:

interface Permissions {
  // Existing permissions...
  canManageDepartments: boolean;      // 🆕 NEW - department-scoped management
  canViewDepartmentReports: boolean;  // 🆕 NEW - department-scoped reporting
  canManageDepartmentTasks: boolean;  // 🆕 NEW - department-scoped task management
}

// Enhanced manager permissions with departmental scope:
manager: {
  // Core departmental management capabilities
  canManageDepartments: true,         // 🆕 Department oversight within scope
  canViewDepartmentReports: true,     // 🆕 Department analytics access
  canManageDepartmentTasks: true,     // 🆕 Departmental task management
  
  // Updated existing permissions
  canViewReports: true,               // 🔧 Enable report access
  canCreateTasks: true,               // 🔧 Enable task creation
  canEditTasks: true,                 // 🔧 Enable task editing
}
```

### **Phase 2: Navigation Logic Redesign (HIGH PRIORITY)**
**Duration**: 1 hour  
**Risk**: LOW - Isolated navigation changes  
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 completion

#### 2.1 Remove Manager Role Exclusions
```typescript
// File: client/src/components/navigation.tsx
// Current problematic navigation conditions:

// BEFORE (PROBLEMATIC):
{ path: "/projects", condition: !isEmployee && !isDepartmentManager },
{ path: "/tasks", condition: !isEmployee && !isDepartmentManager && (...) },

// AFTER (CORRECTED):
{ path: "/projects", condition: permissions.canViewAllProjects },
{ path: "/tasks", condition: permissions.canCreateTasks || permissions.canEditTasks },
{ path: "/reports", condition: permissions.canViewReports },
```

#### 2.2 Permission-Based Navigation Logic
```typescript
// File: client/src/components/navigation.tsx
// SYSTEMATIC APPROACH - Replace all role-based exclusions with permission-based inclusion:

const getNavItemsForRole = (permissions: any, role: any) => {
  const conditionalItems = [
    // Pure permission-based conditions (no role exclusions)
    { path: "/projects", label: "Projects", icon: FolderOpen, 
      condition: permissions.canViewAllProjects },
    
    { path: "/tasks", label: "Tasks", icon: CheckSquare, 
      condition: permissions.canCreateTasks || permissions.canEditTasks },
    
    { path: "/reports", label: "Reports", icon: FileBarChart, 
      condition: permissions.canViewReports },
    
    { path: "/employees", label: "Employees", icon: Users, 
      condition: permissions.canManageEmployees },
    
    { path: "/departments", label: "Departments", icon: Building2, 
      condition: permissions.canViewDepartmentData || permissions.canManageDepartments },
    
    // Admin-only functions (correctly restrictive)
    { path: "/organizations", label: "Organizations", icon: Building, 
      condition: role.isAdmin() },
    
    { path: "/admin/users", label: "User Management", icon: UserCog, 
      condition: role.isAdmin() },
  ];
};
```

### **Phase 3: Page-Level Authorization Enhancement (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
**Duration**: 1.5 hours  
**Risk**: LOW - Additional protective measures  
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 completion

#### 3.1 Departments Page Access Logic
```typescript
// File: client/src/pages/departments.tsx
// Current overly restrictive protection:

// BEFORE (ADMIN-ONLY):
if (!isLoading && isAuthenticated && !canManageSystem) {
  // Blocks ALL non-admin users including managers
}

// AFTER (MANAGER-INCLUSIVE):
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isLoading && !isAuthenticated) {
    // Redirect unauthenticated users
    return;
  }
  
  // Allow managers with departmental permissions OR admins
  if (!isLoading && isAuthenticated && 
      !(permissions.canManageDepartments || permissions.canManageSystem)) {
    toast({
      title: "Access Denied",
      description: "Department management access required.",
      variant: "destructive",
    });
    window.location.href = "/";
  }
}, [isLoading, isAuthenticated, permissions.canManageDepartments, permissions.canManageSystem]);
```

#### 3.2 Reports Page Access Implementation
```typescript
// File: client/src/pages/reports.tsx (if exists)
// NEW - Proper manager access to departmental reporting

useEffect(() => {
  if (!isLoading && isAuthenticated && !permissions.canViewReports) {
    toast({
      title: "Access Denied", 
      description: "Report viewing access required.",
      variant: "destructive",
    });
    window.location.href = "/";
  }
}, [isLoading, isAuthenticated, permissions.canViewReports]);
```

### **Phase 4: Server Route Authorization Alignment (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
**Duration**: 2 hours  
**Risk**: MEDIUM - Server-side authorization changes  
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 completion

#### 4.1 Department Management Route Enhancement
```typescript
// File: server/routes.ts
// Current admin-only restrictions need departmental scoping:

// BEFORE (ADMIN-ONLY):
app.put("/api/departments/:id", isAuthenticated, async (req: any, res) => {
  const userRole = user?.role || 'employee';
  if (userRole !== 'admin') {
    return res.status(403).json({ message: "Insufficient permissions" });
  }
});

// AFTER (DEPARTMENT-SCOPED):
app.put("/api/departments/:id", isAuthenticated, async (req: any, res) => {
  const userRole = user?.role || 'employee';
  const departmentId = req.params.id;
  
  // Allow admins (global) OR managers (departmental scope)
  if (userRole === 'admin') {
    // Admin can manage any department
    const department = await storage.updateDepartment(departmentId, req.body, userId);
    return res.json(department);
  }
  
  if (userRole === 'manager') {
    // Manager can only manage their assigned department
    const userDepartmentId = user?.departmentId;
    if (userDepartmentId === departmentId) {
      const department = await storage.updateDepartment(departmentId, req.body, userId);
      return res.json(department);
    }
  }
  
  return res.status(403).json({ message: "Insufficient permissions to manage this department" });
});
```

#### 4.2 Task Management Route Implementation
```typescript
// File: server/routes.ts
// ADD proper manager access to task management:

app.post("/api/tasks", isAuthenticated, async (req: any, res) => {
  const userRole = user?.role || 'employee';
  
  // Allow task creation for project_managers, managers, and admins
  if (!['admin', 'project_manager', 'manager'].includes(userRole)) {
    return res.status(403).json({ message: "Insufficient permissions to create tasks" });
  }
  
  // Implement departmental scoping for managers
  if (userRole === 'manager') {
    // Verify task is within manager's departmental scope
    // (implementation depends on task-department relationship)
  }
  
  const task = await storage.createTask(req.body, userId);
  res.status(201).json(task);
});
```

## 🧪 **COMPREHENSIVE TESTING STRATEGY**

### **Phase 1 Testing: Permission Model Validation**
```markdown
TEST PLAN - Manager Permission Model:
1. Switch to manager role via role testing
2. Verify navigation shows: Dashboard, Time Entry, Time Log, Projects, Tasks, Reports, Employees, Departments
3. Verify navigation hides: Organizations, User Management (admin-only)
4. Test permission object returns: canViewReports: true, canCreateTasks: true, canEditTasks: true

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- Manager sees expanded navigation matching business role ✅
- Permission checks return appropriate manager capabilities ✅
- No TypeScript/runtime errors from permission changes ✅
```

### **Phase 2 Testing: Navigation Functionality**
```markdown
TEST PLAN - Navigation Access:
1. As manager role, click Projects link → Should access projects page
2. As manager role, click Tasks link → Should access tasks page  
3. As manager role, click Reports link → Should access reports page
4. As manager role, click Departments link → Should access departments page
5. Verify admin-only links remain hidden

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- All manager-appropriate pages accessible ✅
- No access denied redirects for legitimate manager functions ✅
- Admin-only functions remain properly restricted ✅
```

### **Phase 3 Testing: Page-Level Authorization**
```markdown
TEST PLAN - Direct Page Access:
1. As manager, navigate directly to /departments → Should allow access
2. As manager, navigate directly to /reports → Should allow access
3. As manager, navigate directly to /organizations → Should redirect (admin-only)
4. As employee, navigate to /departments → Should redirect (insufficient permissions)

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- Manager accesses appropriate pages directly ✅
- Page-level protection works for unauthorized roles ✅
- Appropriate error messages displayed ✅
```

### **Phase 4 Testing: Server Route Authorization**
```markdown
TEST PLAN - API Endpoint Access:
1. As manager, attempt department update API call → Should succeed for assigned department
2. As manager, attempt department update for different department → Should fail with appropriate error
3. As manager, attempt task creation → Should succeed
4. Test departmental scoping works correctly

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- Manager API access works within departmental scope ✅
- Proper authorization failures for out-of-scope operations ✅
- Server-side validation aligns with frontend permissions ✅
```

## 🛡️ **RISK ASSESSMENT & MITIGATION**

### **Phase 1 Risks: MEDIUM**
- **Risk**: Permission model changes could break existing functionality
- **Mitigation**: Incremental permission additions, maintain backward compatibility
- **Testing**: Comprehensive role testing for all roles after each change
- **Rollback**: Individual permission property reversion

### **Phase 2 Risks: LOW**
- **Risk**: Navigation changes could hide legitimate links
- **Mitigation**: Permission-based logic more precise than role exclusions
- **Testing**: Navigation validation for each role
- **Rollback**: Restore original navigation conditions

### **Phase 3 Risks: LOW**
- **Risk**: Page protection could be overly permissive
- **Mitigation**: Additive approach - expand access rather than reduce
- **Testing**: Direct page access validation
- **Rollback**: Restore original page protection logic

### **Phase 4 Risks: MEDIUM**
- **Risk**: Server route changes could introduce security vulnerabilities
- **Mitigation**: Departmental scoping validation, maintain admin override
- **Testing**: API endpoint testing with proper/improper credentials
- **Rollback**: Restore admin-only server route restrictions

### **Comprehensive Risk Mitigation Strategy**
```markdown
SYSTEMATIC ROLLBACK APPROACH:
- Git checkpoint before each phase
- Component-level rollback capability  
- Per-permission rollback for granular control
- Real-time error monitoring during implementation

VALIDATION CHECKPOINTS:
- After Phase 1: Permission model validation
- After Phase 2: Navigation functionality verification
- After Phase 3: Page access control testing
- After Phase 4: Full RBAC system validation

MONITORING STRATEGY:
- Role testing verification after each phase
- LSP diagnostics monitoring for TypeScript errors
- Server log monitoring for authorization failures
- User experience validation for each role
```
