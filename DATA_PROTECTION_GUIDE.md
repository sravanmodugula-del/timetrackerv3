# Data Protection Guide

## Root Cause Analysis - Data Loss Issue

**What Happened**: The `time_entries` table was completely emptied, causing the admin dashboard to appear broken.

**Why It Happened**: The `database_export.sql` file contains `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS time_entries CASCADE;` commands that when executed, delete all data.

## Data Recovery Actions Taken

1. ✅ **Restored Original Data**: Recovered all 16 original time entries from `database_export.sql`
2. ✅ **Added Conflict Handling**: Used `ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING` to prevent duplicate key errors
3. ✅ **Verified Admin Access**: Confirmed admin can see all data from all users

## Prevention Measures

### 1. Database Backup Strategy
- **Automated Backups**: Database is automatically backed up by Neon
- **Export File**: `database_export.sql` serves as point-in-time backup
- **Recovery Commands**: Use individual INSERT statements, never run full DROP/CREATE

### 2. Safe Database Operations
```sql
-- ✅ SAFE: Add new data
INSERT INTO time_entries (...) VALUES (...) ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- ❌ DANGEROUS: Never run these in production
DROP TABLE time_entries;
DELETE FROM time_entries;
TRUNCATE time_entries;
```

### 3. Development vs Production
- **Development Database**: Can be safely reset/recreated
- **Production Database**: Protected by Replit - users must use database pane
- **Testing**: Use sample data insertion, not table recreation

## Current Data Status

**Time Entries**: 20 total (16 original + 4 sample)
**Users**: 2 (admin + regular user)  
**Projects**: 5 active projects
**Admin Access**: ✅ Full superuser access working

## If Data Loss Occurs Again

1. **Don't Panic**: The original data exists in `database_export.sql`
2. **Restore Data**: Use the INSERT statements from lines 190-207
3. **Check Logs**: Look for any DROP/DELETE/TRUNCATE commands
4. **Contact Support**: If production database affected

## Best Practices

- Never run database schema scripts in production
- Use INSERT with ON CONFLICT for safe data restoration  
- Test admin access after any database changes
- Keep `database_export.sql` as authoritative backup
- Monitor database operations in logs
