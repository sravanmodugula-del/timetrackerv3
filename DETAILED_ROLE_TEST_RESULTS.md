## 📊 Live Test Results

### 🔧 Admin Role (SUPERUSER)
```
✅ Project Creation: SUCCESS
✅ Project Editing: Can edit ANY project from ANY user  
✅ Project Deletion: Can delete ANY project
✅ Employee Assignment: Can assign ANY employee to ANY project
✅ Data Access: Sees ALL data across entire system
✅ System Management: Full administrative access
```

**Data Scoping**: Admin sees **ALL 71 time entries** from all users

### 👨‍💼 Project Manager Role
```
✅ Project Creation: SUCCESS  
✅ Project Editing: Can edit OWN projects + assigned projects
❌ Project Deletion: BLOCKED (admin-only feature)
✅ Employee Assignment: Can assign employees to managed projects
✅ Data Access: Sees enterprise-wide projects + owned projects
```

**Key Difference**: Project Managers can create and manage projects but cannot delete them. They have broader project visibility than managers but less than admin.

### 👥 Manager Role (Department Oversight)
```
❌ Project Creation: BLOCKED - "Insufficient permissions" 
❌ Project Editing: BLOCKED
❌ Project Deletion: BLOCKED
❌ Employee Assignment: BLOCKED
✅ Data Access: Can view department-wide data
✅ Employee Oversight: Can view all employees for oversight
```

**Purpose**: Managers are for department oversight, NOT project management. They can view but not modify projects.

### 👤 Employee Role (Basic User)
```
❌ Project Creation: BLOCKED
❌ Project Editing: BLOCKED  
❌ Project Deletion: BLOCKED
❌ Employee Assignment: BLOCKED
⚠️ Data Access: Only assigned projects and own time entries
